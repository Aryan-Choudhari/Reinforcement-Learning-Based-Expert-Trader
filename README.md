# Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Expert-Trader-
This project builds a Reinforcement Learning trading agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike bots chasing profits, it learns risk-aware strategies, adapts to market shifts, and uses a reward system that values prudent, expert-like decision-making over reckless gains.
